Todo:
- Add a hotkey to toggle starting new dungeon
- Exit script on dungeon complete if not restarting
- file renaming throughout

BugFixes:
- Last row with 2 paintings are a different size, added images and checks for these.

Error handling added:
- Should recover from "An Error Has Occured", and work its way back to the labyrinth from the title menu.
- Added protection against latency on the last row Portal/FinalBoss

Other changes:
- Updated priority scheme (corridor > red, spring > green)
- Added lots of comments
- Added lots of logging
- Pop-up windows on restart and exit

Known Limitations:
- Takes over your screen - you can't really do anything else on the machine, and moving the mouse will throw off the scripting.
- Does not see shimmering paintings
- Always selects group 1 for Enemy Upon You encounters (including Doors).
  - Make sure your group 1 can handle max fatigue.
  - It quick-starts on colored paintings, so can use "minimum" and 3 groups, or "group 1" and a MND group.
